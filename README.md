# chem-extra-credit
Extra credit game for Chem Semester 1. Made by Charlie Tharas.

## Game Execution
To run the game, simply go to the 1.0 release and download the .zip file for the appropriate platform. I am unaware of how the Mac installation functions, but for Windows simply extract the file into a folder of your choice and run the "Chem Extra Credit Game.exe" file to open the game.

## Basic Idea
This game intends to teach students about electron sublevel diagrams. It contains **36** levels corresponding to elements on the periodic table, Carbon being the oen with the lowest atomic number and Radon the one with the highest. All of these atoms are in their ground state and no atoms that have odd atomic numbers are included.

The player will load into a random element, or a random element in a subcategory (transition metals, nonmetals, etc) and play through a short, easy platformer level. The controls are imperfect, however the levels are all still easy. The level consists of circles from an Aufbau chart in the correct bottom-to-top height-ascending order. The horizontal access is not identical for each level/pertinent to the Aufbau diagram.

Once the player beats the level, they will have the option to reveal the element that they just played. Controls are marked within game, but additionally here:

- W to jump, A & D to move left and right
- R to respawn in any level if you become stuck
- Q to quit to the menu from the game and element reveal screen

The menu music is available [here](https://youtu.be/0_1JLok74ds). There is no option to mute it. There is also no quit button in the menu. Display issues may be poorly optimized, and I would like to remind the user that this is an educational extra-credit assignment, not a full-fledged game intended for a production environment.

## Code
This level was designed with Unity 2019.4. Several free assets were grabbed off of the internet for the player model and level background. Nothing in the code is particularly special. I taught myself how to write/create every single aspect of this program from scratch in around 10 hours, prior to a day before submission I had never worked with Unity before.
